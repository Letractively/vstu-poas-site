    <p>The past is not so long ago, the reform of higher education in Russia involves the introduction of bachelor's and master's degrees. The basis of reform and transition to a two-tier system of education laid down the principles of the Bologna Convention.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Let us analyze in detail what the similarities and differences between the bachelors and masters?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Duration of training undergraduate for four years, but the student receives a full education of high school. No black marks in the form of "undergraduate", "incomplete higher education" here does not take place. Upon completion of a graduate who has chosen this system, will receive a diploma of higher education and qualifications or a bachelor's degree (depending on specialization and educational institution). Thus, after studying at the university for one year is less familiar to all "five years", can be safely sent to the job search, and confidently assert employer that has in and can even prove their words corresponding crust.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For those who wish to become an owner of a master's degree training period will last another two years. In this period there is a deeper and more thorough study of certain areas of the Ministry of Education Science. That is, learning to master appropriate and logical for those students who are planning for the future to engage in scientific or teaching activities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It stands alone to emphasize that some experts issue will continue.What kind of university? - You ask. This medical schools and institutes of the Ministry of Defence and the Interior Ministry, part of the technical universities and several others. Entrant will always be able to specify the selection committee what particular system of education it can offer.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Will vary between a curriculum of Bachelors and Masters? The need for consistency and development of various training programs is evident, levels of undergraduate, graduate and specialties should be implemented by the various principles of training. Then, they are different systems. These programs are developed and actively implemented by leading universities of the country, taking into account the interests of major parties in this matter - the employers. On one side is left and especially the socio-economic situation.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Many can be unsettling question: "How bachelors will go to study in the Masters?" Promptly respond to it. Firstly, they will need to re-take the entrance exams. After all, their right to study in master's degree, must prove the selection committee. Students who successfully complete these tests will be able to learn for free and enter the low places, either on a commercial basis. Number of places in the magistracy as compared to undergraduate will be considerably less. Which is also strictly logical.</p>
